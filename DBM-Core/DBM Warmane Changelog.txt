Added Features

- Integrated the addon CL_Fix made by Gmad (Gjeneth @ Warmane - Outland)
  This stops the combatlog from bugging out so often.
  Also means that you don't need to load that addon seperately
  
  
General Modifications

- Changed update download link to https://wow.ayaro.eu/addons/wotlk/
- Added the "/dbm rel" command to broadcast version check results to raid chat instead of self
  This function requires you to be promoted in raid to avoid spam
  This does not (yet) work for party chat
  - Removed the whisper part of this function to avoid the Warmane chat silence and make it less "spammy"
- Set the update notification to enabled by default
  This does not appear to override settings with the notification disabled but works for fresh installs of this edited DBM
- Added the ElvUI main texture to DBM and set it to default
  If you have ElvUI installed, you might see this texture twice in the dropdown list when choosing another texture
- Set the default size of the small bars to 207
- Removed some code that was edited out to reduce file size


Bosstimer Fixes

Raids

- Icecrown Citadel

 - Lord Marrowgar Heroic
  - Fixed Bone Spike timers
  - Fixed Bone Storm timer
  - Fixed Bone Storm cooldown timer
  - Added "Spikes up in..." timer for when Bone Spikes is being cast
    This acts as a secondary timer next to the cooldown timer
  - Added "Whirlwind starts in..." timer for when Bone Storm is being cast
    This acts as a secondary timer next to the cooldown timer

 - Lady Deathwhisper Heroic
  - Fixed heroic mode timers by breaking normal mode
  - Adjusted adds spawn timers to be more accurate
  - Adjusted the first dominate mind timer to be more accurate
    Ability is being used anywhere between 40 and 48 seconds so use it as a cooldown reset timer
  - Added the option to enable automatic removal of Mark/Gift of the Wild after 24 seconds of combat
    The 24 second delay is so that the buff is still active during first trinket uptime
    This option is enabled by default for dps and healers

 - Gunship Battle Heroic
  - Fixed combat start timer
  - Fixed the Battle Mage timer on Alliance side
    Alliance and Horde have seperate code
    I don't play Horde side so that's not getting fixed anytime soon unless someone is willing to provide data

 - Deathbringer Saurfang Heroic
  - Fixed combat start timer for the first pull on Alliance side
    Alliance and Horde have seperate code
    I don't play Horde side so that's not getting fixed anytime soon unless someone is willing to provide data
  - Fixed the timer for the first set of Bloodbeasts

 - Rotface Heroic
  - Fixed Vile Gas timer

 - The Lich King Heroic
  - Fixed combat start timer
  - Fixed the first phase 2 Soul Reaper timer - Thanks to Arrj @ Warmane - Icecrown
  - Fixed Harvest Souls timers for Heroic mode
    Timer for this can sometimes finish 1-3 seconds before the abilty is used cause Warmane


- Ruby Sanctum
 - General Zarithrian
  - Adjusted Fear timer to be more accurate
    First fear seems to be a bit random
  - Adjusted timer for first adds to be more accurate
    First summon adds seems to be a bit random
  - Added "Adds arrive in..." timer

- Trial of the Crusader

 - Northrend Beasts
  - Gormok the Impaler
   - Fixed combat start timer

  - Acidmaw & Dreadscale
   - Fixed combat start timer
   - Adjusted submerge timer to be more accurate, improvements still needed
     Hard cooldown for submerge is 45 seconds, but new timer doesn't trigger untill after worms come up and use a special ability
     Special abilities are being used between 3-5 seconds after the worm comes up again
   - Adjusted emerge timer to be more accurate
     This seems random at best and may as well be removed completely so it stops being annoying

  - Icehowl
   - Fixed timer for Icehowls first Massive Crash
   - Added a seperate timer for the second Massive Crash in case the original timer from DBM doesn't trigger
     It's possible to have two timers up for the second Massive Crash if and when the original timer triggers but that's better than having none
	 
 - Lord Jaraxxus
  - Fixed combat start timer for the first pull
  - Nether Power timers fix and warnings by Nimloth/Lothe @ Warmane Icecrown

  - Fixed timer for the first Nether Portal

_REMOVED_

- Integrated the backport of Lombra's DBM-Profiles done by freix1
  https://github.com/freix1/DBM-Profiles_WotLK
  Thank you DeadlyImpact @ Warmane - Icecrown for pointing me towards this.
  This addon implements AceDB profiles for Deadly Boss Mods, allowing you to share settings among characters.
  Dual spec profiling is supported.
  To manage profiles, open the Deadly Boss Mods configuration window using '/dbm', and select the Profiles category in the Options tab.
  - Updating from version 4.58 or lower will reset your DBM settings!
   !- When you first log in to the game after updating from 4.58 or lower, go to the new DBM Profiles page in the options tab
      Select your current characters name and than adjust settings.
      Log over to your next char, select either the profile from your previous char or select your currently logged char and than use the "copy from" option.
      For some reason it's NOT able to store data in the "Default" profile.
  The Default profile not working properly kinda defeated the point of having this
  It also bugged out some of the options like the color of the DBM Warmings and Special Warnings
  Profiles folder is still included in the zip file with a dummy file for easier installation of this DBM edited
  !- It may be required to delete your DBM SavedVariables if you had version 4.60 with profiles included before updating to anything newer
